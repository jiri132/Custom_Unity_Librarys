For each library tha is out will be an official new repo to get the manager form to install it via packagemanager in unity.<br>

## Development
###Grid manager
Look in the repository of the gridmanager download there will everything be documented

### Sound Manager
Officially not realesed still work in progress to make it as simpel and easy as possible with file names corrosponding to what it is, <br>
a lot of feature that make sound management in Unity easy but it will take a lot of time till it's finished for a early prototype.
